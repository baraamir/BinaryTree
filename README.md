# BinaryTree
A C program that builds a binary tree from a text file (Names.txt) and implements:
Tree Traversals: Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal algorithms.

Level Tracking: Modified pre-order traversal to print node levels (e.g., "Deepika (level 1)").

Node Counting: countNodes() function to calculate total tree nodes.

Visualization: Hand-drawn tree structure submitted as part of the assignment.

Key Features:

Demonstrates hierarchical data parsing and recursive algorithm design.

Includes file I/O operations for real-world data ingestion.

Clean, commented code adhering to strict academic integrity policies.

Academic Context:
Developed for PROG20799 Data Structures (Sheridan College) to fulfill Assignment #4 requirements.
